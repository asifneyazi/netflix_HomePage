The Netflix homepage replica employs HTML and CSS to recreate its layout and styling. It features a responsive design, resembling the original with sections for trending shows, recommended content, and genre categories. Utilizing CSS for precise styling, it mimics Netflix's color scheme, fonts, and card layouts. Interactive elements like hover effects enhance user experience. The layout is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring compatibility across devices. CSS flexbox or grid layouts maintain structural integrity. This project offers a hands-on opportunity to practice front-end web development skills, including layout design, styling techniques, and responsiveness, while also honing CSS proficiency.
